## Prototype for new Web site

This is a (very) small node.js project to prototype a new DBAA Web
site.  This may later serve as the new site, but there's a lot of work
to be done first.

### Next Steps

* Get a "try it, you'll like it" or cheap Web site host
* Learn how to build and deploy Express Web site

OK, I did that.  We're hosted on AWS for now.

I deployed an Express Web site and I have managed to get E-mail and
create login working.

### Next Steps

* Login Page
* Forgot Password Page
* DBAA Directory Load
* Search Directory
